# Changelog

## 0.1.0 (2026-11-03)

First release, for the pilot (step 7.6.b). Built against SamoMind's push
ingestion contract at commit `98d55ccc0091a4bfb013302b5a82cf29b50bd872`
(`docs/API_CONTRACT.md`).

- Settings: API base URL, key id, write-only secret (or the
  `SAMOMIND_API_SECRET` constant), widget embed snippet.
- Signed requests (contract 5.2) with the pinned worked example as a test
  vector.
- Connect and disconnect; status page with connection, sync progress and a
  200-row request log.
- Full sync in the background (Action Scheduler or WP-Cron), resumable from
  the server's cursor, stopping on the plan's page cap.
- Pushes on publish and update, deletes on trash, unpublish, private,
  password and delete; deterministic idempotency keys per event.
- Daily check-in and reconcile; retries with the contract's backoff;
  admin notice after 24 hours of failures.
- Widget snippet in the footer, accepted only from widget.samomind.com.
- WP-CLI: `wp samomind status|connect|disconnect|sync|reconcile|checkin`.
- Uninstall removes all options, transients and scheduled events.
